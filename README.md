This repository was built over the course of two weeks and was a relatively new topic at the time. Java fundamentals and the general architecture of web projects was known. The topic headers were learned during this time and as a result are s bit rough on the edges. 
NOTED drawbacks:
Session manager is not JPA compliant and will have to be changed if project moves away from hibernate. 
UI is basic for CRUD operations
Logic in some areaâ€™s are overcomplicated and could use hibernates features better to reduce boiler plate.
